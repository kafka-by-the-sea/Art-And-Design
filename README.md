# Vorice (2011)
* Songs conjure up reminiscences in the depth of our mind, perhaps the reminiscences about a team of partners, about smiles on our family’s faces, about a remark, or about our love. The moment our reminiscences knock against notes of music and drop from the reservoir of our mind to  arouse emotional ripples, our work “Resonant Ripple” evokes the touching serenity of listening  and feeling, bringing back the original intensity of our memories. Resonant Ripple is operated through a connection of Arduino to a computer: when  the user  nudges  a  ball  into  the  groove,  the device will decide the sequence of music playing according to directions of the rolling ball,  sensed through a reed switch underneath. In addition, the device utilizes LDR to judge the switching on and off of music playing.
